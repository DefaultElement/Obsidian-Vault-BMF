Drakelings, in this universe, are basically short-elves with draconic traits and their own language. They’re more durable and magical than most races, but still very much don’t stack up to a half-dragon in strength or power. They believe other races are below them- except dragons, which they (falsely) see as the gods that created them. They feel their purpose in life is to serve dragons and get a “mate” to have many children with. To do this and prevent inbreeding, they leave their home towns at age 19 in search of someone of the opposite sex, then return home to settle down with their mate. They see violence as a good teaching method and problem solver, though won’t kill each other. They’re group oriented and like having a community. The two usual personalities you’ll see in drakelings are loud and proud, or meek and weak. “Females” are seen as more important to keep happy since they’re the ones making all the babies.
