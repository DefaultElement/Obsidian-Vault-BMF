A [[Drakeling]] town in a magic-drenched hotland near a volcano. On the planet [[Piquesce]].
Trees are almost like stone. Buildings are built on stilts so any stray lava flows under them. Buildings are grouped together for easy catwalks around and between them. Not all groups have bridges between them so there are established paths on the ground as well. Scattered, dark, brittle foliage. Weather is usually overcast with ash replacing precipitation. Town established near magical hot springs, most liquid is found here or inside wildlife. Some is also imported. Goods must be processed before import to be enchanted with heat protection, lest they burn or melt. Not all buildings have plumbing, so there’s not necessarily a central water system. Although common, sinks are still considered a luxury, not the default. Houses may have water tanks of varying sizes, and a common chore for kids and husbands is to refill them. Drakelings tend to wear short and/or airy clothing, many opting out of tops. Shoes are usually sandals, if worn. Non-native mates may conform to the standard or just enchant the clothes they already have to be wearable. Though survivable for most drakelings, some mates may find the heat still too bothersome to live in and reject the town, dragging their mates back to their home instead. It doesn’t grow at a very fast pace compared to towns in more normal places. Mates may also struggle with the air quality and dry atmosphere.
