## Education & Skills

Per probably worked some entry-level jobs in his teens and after, before settling on adventuring as a good fit for him.

Despite not looking much like it, he’s pretty fit and has good stamina for long travel and such. He probably really started being more active in rehab as something healthy to do.

He’s got pretty good aim with his tiny magic guns and has a collection of different kinds.

He doesn’t always pay the most attention to situations and thus isn’t always perfectly thoughtful. It took several instances of Red shielding against him for Per to remember not to touch him.

He’s always ready to make more money and keeps an eye out for any opportunities. Sometimes this leads to questionably legal actions, but generally, he tries to stay out of trouble.

His two main guns are the “Boomerbang” and the “Moonbeam”. The Boomerbang shoots what else but mini magic boomerangs and the Moonbeam fires bursts of moonlight.

## Purpose & Passion

Per just wants to have fun overall in life. Running around outdoors, hanging out with friends, going to parties- what else could anyone want?

Per doesn’t really follow any gods in particular but respects them in general.

## Health & Wellness


## Social

He can be a bit wild and inclined toward violence, but Red is often around to balance this out.

Per is the more social of the Per & Red duo, chatting with anyone who isn’t too serious and/or grumpy.

He feels more comfortable around goblins, orcs, demons; races that are in relatable societal situations. As for the oh-so pretty and magical elves, nymphs, and such, he’s not the biggest fan.

He thinks his house is awesome except for one thing: its location. He’d like to go to the town near it more often, or hang out at the end of the walkway and chat with neighbors, but there are folks around that don’t like goblins and such.
