## Education & Skills

He was picked on in his childhood for his nervous smoke and timidness, and in his teens for “acting gay”. Big sis Reba is much more confident, though, and protected him as best she could. He also of course put his magic to use, mostly shielding but sometimes busting out the fire spells if he really needed to seem strong or just got too fed up.

He’s used to violence being the solution to problems since most drakelings use it in the case of any disagreement, but his parents in particular are pacifistic, making the kids much more peaceful as well. Red specifically will fight in self-defense, though if someone, especially another drakeling, is antagonizing him, he may throw the first metaphorical punch.

He’s naturally become very aware of the people around him at any given moment so he can dodge any attempts to touch him. This also means he’ll be terribly frightened if anyone sneaks up behind him without his notice, intentionally or otherwise.

His dad taught him shielding magic, and does so with all the kids. Red is the one that was most invested in and talented at it, though, so he’s the one most associated with it.

His main weapon is a flute that doubles as a wand. Playing it powers up spells.

## Purpose & Passion

For most of his life, all he wants to do is marry a drakeling woman, go back to a drakeling town, and have kids and a normal drakeling life. He consistently fails in this endeavor but refuses to believe he could do, or even wants to do, anything else.

He dislikes his birthday since it reminds him of how long he’s been away from home.

As a drakeling, he sees dragons as all-powerful, all-knowing gods, despite this being completely false. He’s amazed by and terrified of them, and he feels that his real purpose in life is to serve them unquestioningly. Luckily, the first real dragon he meets doesn’t like anyone trying to serve her, and encourages him to just chill.

As he exists in the outside world and hangs out with people like Per, he slowly shifts from drakelings being the most important thing in his life to his loved ones, drakeling or otherwise, being most important to him. He also sees dragons as gods slightly less, but still pretty much fears and admires them as such despite the dragon he actually knows just wanting to be treated normally by him.

He’s a naturally kind person despite his general mindset and will go out of his way to help others, even if he doesn’t know them. He also cares greatly about his friends and cares very much more about those he admires than himself.

He enjoys reading and goes to a book club, his favorite genre being mysteries. He only likes romance of the most wholesome kind and thus doesn’t read it much. He also likes making and trying new foods, inspired by his mother who made foreign baked goods in his childhood.

He prefers to solve conflicts peacefully, but won’t hesitate to fight if necessary.

## Health & Wellness

He’s generally physically fit and healthy except for the asthma-like symptoms from his backfiring smoke/fire breath. He’ll occasionally go into coughing fits.

Under normal circumstances, he’s a quiet, curious person, but he’s also emotional and can easily be made anxious or depressed.

He’s self-conscious about a lot of things. His uncontrollable smoke/fire breath is both a weakness and something he feels is gross. His wings aren’t large, so he has to use magic to fly and feels uncool. He feels generally unattractive and unlovable after being rejected by love interests so often and feels like there’s something wrong with him that he doesn’t like physical intimacy. He feels “too old” to ever even get a wife at this point— keeping in mind from an outside perspective that drakelings can live up to 1000 years. He generally feels like a disappointment and failure to his family, town, and race as a whole. His family at least doesn’t support this narrative and wants him to be happy.

He has depression, but it’s generally manageable. Generally, when it gets worse it’s triggered by something bad happening and launching him into a downward spiral.

## Social

He needs alone time but gets lonely easily.

He doesn’t want to become too attached to anything before he goes home and leaves it all behind like he’s supposed to. This means it takes a very long time for him to call someone a friend, and he generally avoids trying to make any. Per has managed to earn the title by sticking with and helping Red for years.

He loves giving and receiving compliments, and loves giving gifts but will be caught off guard if given anything himself. He’s known to cry easily over especially kind gifts from loved ones.

He prefers being around feminine people to masculine folks, but not really noticeably.

## Love

He’s the definition of love at first sight, immediately becoming enamored with anyone he finds attractive. He tries to keep to himself and not bother anyone, but will generally still glance often at cute strangers, get distracted by them, and compliment people without thinking.

Despite the fact that he falls for people constantly, Red refuses to properly date anyone other than drakeling women. Of course, ”if someone just wants to hang out, as good acquaintances, in a romantic setting, well, why should he turn them down?” He loves getting positive attention and giving others the same, though one might say he goes a little too far for both. The more he admires someone the more he’ll do to make them like him, and the more he’ll feel the need to express his admiration to them. The most extreme example of this can be seen in his interactions with dragons: he’ll be completely captivated by their beauty, will constantly tell them how amazing they are in every way, and will offer to do anything and everything for them.

As a drakeling he also finds dragons ethereally beautiful, only adding to their amazingness. He can have a physically hard time taking his eyes off of them if one is around.

As a drakeling, dragon-like traits are attractive to him. So on his coolness scale, the Virgin humans and elves etc. < the Chad goblins and demons etc.
